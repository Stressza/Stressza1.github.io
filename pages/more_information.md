"What we see in anxiety disorders often is that people get trapped in this avoidance cycle where they avoid the things that make them anxious and therefore don’t master the skills to cope," Dr. Schueller says. "One of the most effective treatments for anxiety disorders are exposure-based treatments, so things that actually get us to face our fears."
